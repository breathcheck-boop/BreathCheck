Rule of thumb:
- Helpful concern usually leads to a specific next step.
- Unhelpful worry loops without resolution.
Quiz:
1) "I have an exam next week, so I'll plan 2 hours of study tonight."
2) "What if I fail every exam this year and my whole future is ruined?"
3) "I'll check the deadline and ask my teacher if I'm missing anything."

  - Tiny habit: "One small action to try this week."
Example:
- Value: Family
- Goal: "Be more present during dinner."
- Tiny habit: "Put phone away for 10 minutes at dinner."
