# BreathCheck

BreathCheck is a local‑first, privacy‑respecting desktop app for anxiety and worry support. It combines CBT‑style learning, daily tracking, and guided tools, with optional AI‑generated insights. Built with PyQt5, SQLAlchemy, and clean architecture.

## What the app does

### Home
- Quick overview of the app and what you can do
- Keyboard shortcuts list
- Start button that jumps into Learn

### Learn (CBT program)
- 10 modules are listed; **Module 1 is fully implemented**, Modules 2–10 are placeholders and are **locked until the previous module is completed**
- Module 1 is a guided 7‑step flow with progress tracking, saved inputs, and optional media placeholders

**Module list**
1. Orientation & Goals *(full)*
2. Mapping Your Anxiety Cycle *(placeholder)*
3. Tracking Worry Patterns *(placeholder)*
4. Thinking Traps & Balanced Thoughts *(placeholder)*
5. Reducing Avoidance (Exposure Basics) *(placeholder)*
6. Worry Scheduling & Attention Shifting *(placeholder)*
7. Calming the Body (Breathing, Relaxation, Grounding) *(placeholder)*
8. Problem-Solving vs Rumination *(placeholder)*
9. Lifestyle & Habit Support *(placeholder)*
10. Consolidation & Relapse Plan *(placeholder)*

### Track (daily check‑ins)
- Mood / Anxiety / Stress sliders (0–10)
- Notes/trigger input
- **One entry per day** (with confirmation if you overwrite)
- Recent entries in card grid with vertical bars + notes

### Insights (optional AI)
- Line chart from tracker data with filters
- AI insights generated from:
  - tracker logs
  - module inputs
  - tool entries
- Cached insights are shown on next app start

### Tools (guided exercises)
- Breathing exercise (visual pacing)
- Grounding 5‑4‑3‑2‑1
- Thought Log
- Worry Time
- Safe Place visualization
- Each tool supports:
  - multi‑step guided inputs
  - history of past entries
  - optional immediate AI feedback (if key is configured)

### Progress
- Program completion bar
- Tracking streaks with tier indicators
- Milestone cards with images (local)

### About
- App overview, privacy details, and shortcuts
- Send feedback button

### Contact (Philippines)
- Curated list of local organizations and resources

### Settings
- Change master password
- Delete all data (local)
- Delete account (clears data + removes master password)
- Export all data (JSON / CSV / Excel)
- Light/Dark theme, comfort mode, font size controls

### Toast notifications
- Saves, deletions, module completion, milestones, and tool submissions surface in‑app toasts

---

## Security & privacy

- **Local‑first**: all user data is stored locally in SQLite.
- **Master password**: stored as a salted hash in the OS keyring (no recovery flow).
- **Encryption at rest**: sensitive fields are encrypted locally using a key stored in the OS keyring.
- **API key (optional)**: stored in `.env` or the OS keyring.
- No network calls happen unless you explicitly enable AI insights/feedback.

---

## Data storage location

BreathCheck uses `platformdirs` to store the database in the OS‑specific user data directory.

- Default DB file: `breathcheck.db`
- If `DB_PATH` is **relative**, it is stored inside the app data directory.
- If `DB_PATH` is **absolute**, it is used as‑is.

Typical locations (may vary by OS/user):
- Linux: `~/.local/share/BreathCheck/BreathCheck/breathcheck.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/BreathCheck/BreathCheck/breathcheck.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\BreathCheck\\BreathCheck\\breathcheck.db`

---

## Configuration (.env)

Create `.env` from `.env.example`.

Common settings:
- `APP_NAME=BreathCheck`
- `DEBUG=false`
- `DB_PATH=breathcheck.db`
- `AI_API_KEY=...` *(optional; can also be stored in keyring)*
- `AI_MODEL=gpt-5.2`

## Assets (images/audio)

### App logo
- `src/anxiety_app/ui/resources/app_logo.png`

### Module media (images + audio)
Each module has its own folder:
```
src/anxiety_app/ui/resources/modules/module_1/
  images/step_1/...
  audio/step_1/...
```
If a file doesn’t exist, BreathCheck shows a placeholder.
